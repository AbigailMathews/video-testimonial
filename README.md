# Video Testimonial

A React app that allows users to record a brief video or audio testimonial in response to a prompt.

This application was developed in response to a challenge from the nonprofit Listen First, to support their America Talks initiative. America Talks brings together participants from across political and geographical divides to have 1-1 conversations about the topics that are important to them.

This application, along with the [Django backend](https://github.com/AbigailMathews/video-testimonial-backend), allows users to describe their experiences in video or audio, right after they participate in a conversation. This app uses the getUserMedia API, with some help from the [react-mic](https://github.com/hackingbeauty/react-mic) and [react-webcam](https://github.com/mozmorris/react-webcam) packages.

A live demo is available at [https://elastic-morse-60fe4f.netlify.app/](https://elastic-morse-60fe4f.netlify.app/)
